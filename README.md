HeroesOfPymoli_Challenge

About the pandas-challenge homework:

This homework focused on analyzing data for a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli. Since players are encouraged to purchase optional items to enhance playing experience, the analysis of this data by requested metrics was done. The project used jupiter notebook as the analysis platform with pandas library imported for processing and analyzing the data acquired in a csv format. The pandas dataframe object made presenting the analysis results a lot more pleasing to the eye and aesthetically structured for easy read. 


From the analysis, here are three observable trends retrieved from the data:
1. Purchase of the game was higher among male players. It appears they were given better price deals, since males spend less per purchase than females, which means much of the sales is designed to encourage males who are seen as more passionate about the game. Males accounted for 84% of invested players and they spent about 5 times more than female players. 

2. The highest percentage of players fall within the 20 - 24 age range as some of these folks are recent college graduates or still setting themselves up for a career and tend to spend much of their time on video games especially one so well designed to attract and engage this age bracket. Also about 76% of players fall within 15 - 29 years old age bracket. It makes sense therefore to aim for this age bracket for making a success of a video gaming business.

3. Finally from the data, it appears the free-to-play games are just appetizers as the optional items appear to provide the most fun, enticing players to make purchases. Since the marginal costs are low, about $4 on average, male players mostly feel inclined to spend a little to enjoy the fun. "Final Critic" appears to be the most profitable game option for the independent gaming company, so it stands to reason that it will get the most attention in design and marketing to engage more players, helping to increase profits.
